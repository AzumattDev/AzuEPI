# Description

## AzuEPI is Extended Player Inventory

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

What is the difference in this version of ExtendedPlayerInventory compared to others posted?
    * This version comes with more compatibility in mind, as well as a few more features.
        * One core feature is making it very very hard to lose your items, even when your inventory bugs out.
        * It also comes with an API for mods/mod authors to add custom slots to the inventory. This is used by Jewelcrafting to add dedicated slots for the utility items.

Recommended to install via [r2modman](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
or [Thundersore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager)

If you are installing this manually, you will need to make
sure [BepInEx for Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) is installed
correctly. Then, just make sure the dll ends up in your BepInEx/plugins folder.
