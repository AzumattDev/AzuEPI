| 1.0.2     | - Use a Keyboard Shortcut fix from Margmas to allow you to walk and use your quickslot keys at the same time. We live in the future now! BepInEx should really handle this better and not need this workaround.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 1.0.1     | - Update to add forgotten chest UI dragging<br/>- Changed the config file a lot. `YOU WILL NEED TO REGENERATE YOUR CONFIG FILE` to make it work properly<br/>- Add command `azuepi fix` to fix your inventory manually if there are issues<br/>- Implement inventory Auto fixer that will attempt to fix your inventory if something is wrong by opening and closing your inventory. Will also run once after "Take All" is used on a chest, just in case. Uses vanilla methods to do this, and shouldn't cause item loss. |
