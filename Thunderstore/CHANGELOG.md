| 1.3.7     | - When you had something like EpicLoot that used custom properties on items, it wasn't properly copying that information for the items in the quickslots (not gear slots, those were fine). That's just not Epic. Well, it's now Epic again as I have fixed the issue. Additionally added some checks for when your inventory is full, just in case you're an overweight Viking.                                                                                                                                           |

Though the action performed it's job, it could sometimes throw an error to the console.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1.0.4     | - Seems some people were having issues on 0.214.2 of the game. I didn't see any, but here is a version compiled against it just in case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1.0.3     | - Fix a compatibility issue with Cheb's Necromancy which would cause this mod to throw errors. He still needs to fix his code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1.0.2     | - Use a Keyboard Shortcut fix from Margmas to allow you to walk and use your quickslot keys at the same time. We live in the future now! BepInEx should really handle this better and not need this workaround.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 1.0.1     | - Update to add forgotten chest UI dragging<br/>- Changed the config file a lot. `YOU WILL NEED TO REGENERATE YOUR CONFIG FILE` to make it work properly<br/>- Add command `azuepi fix` to fix your inventory manually if there are issues<br/>- Implement inventory Auto fixer that will attempt to fix your inventory if something is wrong by opening and closing your inventory. Will also run once after "Take All" is used on a chest, just in case. Uses vanilla methods to do this, and shouldn't cause item loss. |
| 1.0.0     | Initial Release                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
