| 1.3.12    | - When you break something in a mod of this size, you hear about it fast. Good news is I have a lot of new friends in my DMs and Discord. Bad news is (or good news if you're one of the people that hate me now), the slots have been reverted/removed. The configuration options for them still exist as I do plan to implement them again. This is just a hotfix to make people more happy and to continue with their life. Next time it will be toggleable or something. Love me again?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 1.3.10    | - Dragging and dropping items from your equipment slots will now unequip them and put them where you placed it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1.3.9     | - ZenDragon pestered me a few times that his players were losing their shiny gear mid-battle because their pockets were stuffed and they couldn't dodge a hit to save their loot. Consider this update my way of holding your hand as you bravely make questionable battle choices and hoard like a dragon (even with your extended inventory!). Now, your treasures won't get an express ticket to the ground just because you decided to turn your inventory into a clown car. Happy hoarding and try not to get thwacked too much, yeah? Details on the update are below.<br/><br/> - When you have a full inventory and your gear in the equipment slots loses durability, they do not drop due to being outside of the normal inventory grid and attempting to add them back to your inventory failed.<br/> - If unequipping an item inside your slots cannot be added to your inventory due to it being full, the action is now prevented and prompted to the user why. Instead of dropping the item to the ground when you attempt to unequip with a full inventory. <br/><br/>`Remember: dodging is key, hoarding is an art, and your gear is now safer than ever. Fight smarter, not harder, and maybe clean out your pockets once in a while.` |
| 1.3.8     | - Fix for Marketplace's Transmog causing issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.3.7     | - When you had something like EpicLoot that used custom properties on items, it wasn't properly copying that information for the items in the quickslots (not gear slots, those were fine). That's just not Epic. Well, it's now Epic again as I have fixed the issue. Additionally added some checks for when your inventory is full, just in case you're an overweight Viking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 1.0.1     | - Update to add forgotten chest UI dragging<br/>- Changed the config file a lot. `YOU WILL NEED TO REGENERATE YOUR CONFIG FILE` to make it work properly<br/>- Add command `azuepi fix` to fix your inventory manually if there are issues<br/>- Implement inventory Auto fixer that will attempt to fix your inventory if something is wrong by opening and closing your inventory. Will also run once after "Take All" is used on a chest, just in case. Uses vanilla methods to do this, and shouldn't cause item loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
